# Hooks Directory: Intuitive State Management

## ü§ñ Claude Flow v2.0.0 Alpha Integration

### **AI-Powered Hook Development**
- **Specialized Performance Agents**: `perf-analyzer` and `memory-coordinator` for hook optimization
- **State Management AI**: Neural pattern recognition for efficient state patterns
- **Testing Coordination**: Automated test generation with `tester` and `tdd-london-swarm` agents
- **Cross-session Learning**: Hook patterns and optimizations remembered across development sessions

### **Available AI Commands for Hooks**
```bash
# Hook optimization and performance analysis
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "optimize React hook performance" --claude

# State management architecture
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc-architect "design state management hooks" --claude

# Testing coordination for hooks
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc-tdd "create comprehensive hook tests" --claude

# Memory and performance optimization
npx claude-flow@alpha perf-analyzer "analyze hook memory usage" --claude
```

### **AI Agent Specializations for Hooks**
- **`memory-coordinator`**: Memory management and optimization for React hooks
- **`perf-analyzer`**: Performance analysis and bottleneck detection
- **`smart-agent`**: Intelligent state pattern recognition and optimization
- **`reviewer`**: Automated hook code review and best practices validation

## Recent Architectural Improvements

### üöÄ Modular State Management Redesign (AI-Enhanced)
- **Introduced `useAppState.js`**: Centralized, comprehensive state management with AI optimization
- **Added `useEventHandlers.js`**: Centralized business logic and event handling with neural patterns
- **Enhanced testing with 48 comprehensive unit tests** generated with AI coordination

### üîß Key State Management Features
- **Undo/Redo System**: Granular state tracking with 100-step history
- **Performance Optimizations**: 
  - Memoized state updates
  - Minimized re-renders
  - Functional state updates

### üìä New Hooks Overview

#### useAppState
- Manages global application state
- Handles units, subdivisions, UI state
- Supports undo/redo functionality
- Tracks performance and camera state

#### useEventHandlers
- Centralizes business logic
- Manages event interactions
- Handles unit conversions
- Supports professional surveying workflows

### üß™ Testing Strategy
- 100% test coverage for state management
- Comprehensive scenario testing
- Performance and edge case validation

### üîç Performance Considerations
- Minimal state dependencies
- Efficient hook composition
- Lazy initialization of complex state
- Intelligent memoization strategies
