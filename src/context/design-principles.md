# Design Principles

## Core Principles

### Professional Surveying Focus
- Design UI and interactions to match professional land surveying and CAD software expectations
- Use industry-standard terminology and measurement units
- Implement precise input controls with decimal precision
- Provide professional-grade output formats (Excel, PDF)

### Precision Over Convenience
- Prioritize accuracy in measurements and calculations over simplified user experience
- Always show exact values, not rounded approximations
- Provide fine-grained control over positioning and sizing
- Maintain mathematical precision in all calculations

### Visual Clarity
- Ensure all measurements, labels, and subdivisions are clearly readable and distinguishable
- Use high contrast colors for important elements
- Implement proper font sizing and spacing
- Provide clear visual hierarchy

### Non-Destructive Editing
- Allow users to modify, move, and adjust elements without losing data
- Implement undo/redo functionality where possible
- Preserve original data when making edits
- Allow cancellation of operations

### Progressive Disclosure
- Show basic features first, with advanced tools accessible but not overwhelming
- Use collapsible panels and modal dialogs for complex features
- Implement intuitive tool progression from simple to advanced
- Provide clear entry points for advanced functionality

### Immediate Feedback
- Provide real-time visual feedback for all drawing, measuring, and editing operations
- Show preview states during interactions
- Use hover states and visual cues
- Implement smooth animations for state changes

### Consistent Interaction Patterns
- Use consistent mouse/touch interactions across all tools (draw, select, measure, edit)
- Maintain standard keyboard shortcuts and conventions
- Implement consistent button placement and styling
- Use familiar interaction paradigms

### Data Integrity
- Maintain precision in calculations and ensure all exported data matches displayed values
- Validate all user inputs
- Prevent data corruption during operations
- Ensure consistent units throughout the application

### Accessibility
- Ensure tools work with keyboard navigation and provide clear visual indicators for all states
- Implement proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Provide alternative interaction methods
- Support screen readers and assistive technologies

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Layout
- Use responsive grid systems
- Maintain consistent spacing (8px grid system)
- Implement clear visual hierarchy
- Provide adequate white space

### Typography
- Use professional, readable fonts
- Maintain consistent font sizes and weights
- Ensure proper contrast ratios
- Use typography to establish hierarchy

### Color Usage
- Blue (#3b82f6) for primary land areas
- Varied colors for subdivisions (systematic color assignment)
- High contrast for text and important elements
- Consistent color meanings throughout the app

### Interaction States
- Clear hover states for interactive elements
- Distinct selected states
- Disabled states when appropriate
- Loading states for async operations

### Form Controls
- Clear labels and placeholders
- Validation feedback
- Logical tab order
- Appropriate input types

## Performance Principles

### Rendering Optimization
- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Implement proper key props for lists
- Minimize re-renders through careful state management
- Use lazy loading where appropriate

### Three.js Performance
- Limit subdivision count to prevent performance issues
- Cap comparison object rendering at 50 items
- Use efficient geometry and materials
- Implement proper cleanup for Three.js objects

### User Experience
- Provide loading indicators for slow operations
- Implement smooth transitions and animations
- Ensure responsive interactions
- Minimize perceived wait times
