## üåç What is Land Visualizer?

Land Visualizer transforms abstract land measurements into clear, visual representations that anyone can understand. Whether you're buying property, planning a development, or simply curious about land dimensions, our intuitive web platform makes it easy to grasp exactly how big any area really is.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### For Everyone
- **Smart Area Input**: Enter your land size in any unit - we'll handle the conversion
- **Visual Comparisons**: See your land compared to soccer fields, houses, parking spaces, and more
- **Custom Shape Drawing**: Sketch your actual property boundaries with simple click-and-drag tools
- **Instant Visualization**: Watch your land come to life in interactive 3D
- **Zero Learning Curve**: No CAD knowledge or software installation needed
- **Works Everywhere**: Perfect on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Professional Capabilities
- **Accurate Measurements**: Reliable calculations for planning purposes
- **Multiple Export Options**: Save as PDF, Excel, or share via QR code
- **Unit Flexibility**: Switch between metric and imperial with one click
- **Full Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant for inclusive design
- **3D Exploration**: Walk through your property in immersive 3D
