# Session Memory Storage

## Purpose
This directory stores session-based memory data, conversation history, and contextual information for development sessions using the Claude-Flow orchestration system.

## Land Visualizer Development Context
Session memory supports the development of a professional 3D land visualization and surveying application:
- **Feature Development Sessions**: Track implementation of measurement tools, 3D rendering, and subdivision management
- **Testing and QA Sessions**: Document testing strategies for measurement accuracy and cross-platform compatibility
- **Accessibility Implementation**: Record WCAG compliance improvements and assistive technology integration
- **Performance Optimization**: Log 3D rendering optimizations and WebGL performance tuning
- **Professional Workflow Integration**: Capture decisions related to surveying, real estate, and construction industry requirements

## Structure
Sessions are organized by date and session ID for easy retrieval:

```
memory/sessions/
├── 2024-01-10/
│   ├── session_001/
│   │   ├── metadata.json        # Session metadata and configuration
│   │   ├── conversation.md      # Full conversation history
│   │   ├── decisions.md         # Key decisions and rationale
│   │   ├── artifacts/           # Generated files and outputs
│   │   └── coordination_state/  # Coordination system snapshots
│   └── ...
└── shared/
    ├── patterns.md              # Common session patterns
    └── templates/               # Session template files
```

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Session Isolation**: Each session gets its own directory
2. **Metadata Completeness**: Always fill out session metadata
3. **Conversation Logging**: Document all significant interactions
4. **Artifact Organization**: Structure generated files clearly
5. **State Preservation**: Snapshot coordination state regularly

## Professional Standards Integration
1. **Measurement Precision**: Document all decisions affecting survey-grade accuracy requirements
2. **Industry Compliance**: Track legal and professional standard adherence (real estate, surveying)
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Record testing across professional hardware configurations
4. **User Experience**: Document UX decisions for professional surveying workflows
5. **Integration Requirements**: Track compatibility with CAD, GIS, and other professional tools
