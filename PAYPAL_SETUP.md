# PayPal Integration Setup Guide

## Steps to Connect Your PayPal Account

### 1. Create PayPal Developer Account
1. Go to https://developer.paypal.com/
2. Sign in with your PayPal business account
3. Click "Create App" in the Developer Dashboard

### 2. Get Your PayPal Credentials
1. Create a new app and select "Default Application"
2. Choose "Sandbox" for testing, "Live" for production
3. Copy your **Client ID** from the app dashboard

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Replace the values in your `.env` file:

```bash
# For Sandbox Testing
REACT_APP_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_sandbox_client_id_here
REACT_APP_PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox

# For Production
REACT_APP_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_live_client_id_here  
REACT_APP_PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=live
```

### 4. Test Your Integration

#### Sandbox Testing:
- Use PayPal's test accounts (available in your developer dashboard)
- No real money is charged
- Perfect for testing the flow

#### Going Live:
1. Change environment to "live" 
2. Use your live Client ID
3. Submit your app for PayPal review if required
4. Real payments will be processed

### 5. PayPal Fees
- PayPal charges 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction in the US
- International fees may vary
- Check PayPal's fee structure for your region

### 6. Important Notes
- Keep your Client Secret secure (never expose it in frontend code)
- The current implementation uses client-side only (suitable for digital goods)
- For physical goods, you may need server-side order verification
- Always test thoroughly in sandbox before going live
